# Grokking Algorithms in Python 🧠🐍

Welcome to my **Grokking Algorithms in Python** repository! This is a personal project where I’m practicing and implementing algorithms as I learn them from the book **Grokking Algorithms** by Aditya Bhargava.

## 📚 About the Book

**Grokking Algorithms** is an illustrated, friendly guide that teaches the basics of algorithms in a fun and accessible way. The book covers essential algorithms, how they work, and how to implement them in code.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

This repository is organized by chapters, with each chapter focusing on different algorithms or data structures. Here’s how the project is structured:

### Folders and Files

- **ChapterXX**: Each folder represents a chapter in the book.
- **`algorithm_name.py`**: Python script files where I practice the implementation of specific algorithms discussed in the chapter.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

### Running the Code

To run any of the Python scripts, simply navigate to the respective chapter directory and execute the script:

```bash
cd Chapter01
python binary_search.py
